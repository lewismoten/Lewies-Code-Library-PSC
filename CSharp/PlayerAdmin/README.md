### Ultima Player Administration

*8/8/2004 12:43:11 AM*

Maintain a list of player names, accounts, IP addresses, and assign flags. Search, Edit, Delete, Export, Import. This little utility was made at the request of my wife who is an administrator on an Ultima emulator shard. Greate for beginners wanting to learn how to do some of the basics.
