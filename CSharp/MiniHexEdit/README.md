### Lewies Mini Hex Editor

*8/1/2004 12:00:20 AM*

This small utility aids programmers into viewing and editing the data within binary files. Works with large files very nicely. Enter either the hex, decimal, or text value of each byte. You can also edit bits. I use programs like these when learning how to read file structures such as MP3, GIF, and JPG files. Also comes with a handy setup project for easy installation.
