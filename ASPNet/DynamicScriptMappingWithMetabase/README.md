### Dynamic ScriptMapping with Metabase

*9/20/2003 9:43:23 AM*

Allows you to assign almost any extension to be processed by the ASPX script processor. You may add, update, and remove the extension progromatically without opening the IIS Manager. Great for those of you who do not have access to the machines desktop (such as hosted at other ISPs).
