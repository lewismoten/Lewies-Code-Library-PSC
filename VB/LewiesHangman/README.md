### Lewie's Hangman

So why is my version of hang man so cool? well - I don't know. I havn't looked at the others. This one lets you build your own list and "click" your way through the came. Click on each letter and it will be filled in (or a new piece of the hang man will be drawn.) Each game gets 6 wrong answers. You may also guess the phrase.
