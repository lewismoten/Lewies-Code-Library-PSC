### Simple Log Routine

*6/1/2001 12:11:47 PM*

Simple routine that logs a sting to a specified log file. also supports word-wrapping on long lines (more then 80 characters) and inserts an empty line before and after the information so it is easier to read. This code is mainly here for my own personal reference.
