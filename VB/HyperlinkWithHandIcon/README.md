### Hyperlink with Hand Icon

*6/4/2002 9:01:22 PM*

Includes demonstration of how to make labels appear as hyperlinks, open the users default web browser, and uses a hand cursor when hovering over the icon. The hand.cur file is loaded seperately so that you may incorporate it into your other applications.
