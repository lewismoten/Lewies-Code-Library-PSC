### ASP Whois Component with sample code

*2/18/2001 7:25:05 PM*

I was searching on the 'net for a whois COM object and everyone is charging $20 - $250 for a very simple object. I was a little low on cash and had the day off. This COM object includes ASP code and a list of over 250 whois databases on the net.
