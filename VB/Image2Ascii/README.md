### Image 2 Ascii

*5/25/2002 11:22:55 AM*

The Image 2 Ascii converter allows you to load a photograph, and then generate an ascii image that looks simular to it. You can use this ascii version to post a picture of your self on news groups, message boards, email signatures, and more. No longer is text-only formatting a constraint for displaying photographs!
