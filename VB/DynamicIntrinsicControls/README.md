### Dynamic Intrinsic Controls

*6/21/2001 6:28:09 PM*

This demo shows you how to dynamically create a FileListBox control via vb Code rather then at design time. The reason I choose to create this was that I needed to get a list of files within a directory via. a DLL. The file system object causes too much overhead and this little trick makes the code run much faster. For testing purposes, just create a new EXE and throw this onto Form1.
