### URL Thumbnail Generator

*8/23/2002 12:40:55 AM*

Creates thumbnail versions of web pages and saves to an image. Personal project in development to later store within a database containing links to other sites to offer a link preview. Have not been able to create images when hiding the web browser object. Now supports frames and pages with onLoad javascript events.
