### Key Snooper

*8/5/2002 10:13:11 PM*

Monitor any key typed on the keyboard. Use the GUI to test, or supply a file name and run in the background. Uses GetAsyncKeyState API and GetKeyState. Great for finding out what children or spouses are doing on the internet. Instructions included to start the program when the Operating system starts.
