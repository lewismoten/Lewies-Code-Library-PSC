### PageRange

*12/2/2000 5:39:20 PM*

I had database searches that were returning way too many pages to display an option to view each page. What I did was set up this procedure to return a range of pages, and also options to jump ahead, back, first page, last page, previouse page, and/or the next page. This routine tells you what those links are.
