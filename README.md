# Lewies Code Library PSC

All open source projects that I had published to Planet Source Code. Many of these files range from the late 90's to the early 2000's.

The most notable scripts are to upload files over Classic ASP, in which I had won awards for and has spread through the community. At the time, vendors would charge upwards of $700 for a COM object providing the capability. Many developers at the time had shared hosts that restricted access to uploading COM objects. I dug into the RFC and learned how to read the data. Over time, I learned how to speed up the process to parse file uploads by using the ADODB Stream, which was intended to work with database streams, but provided by Microsoft and available on most IIS server installations. Once ASP.Net came out, downloading files was built-in.

## Upload Files Without COM

- [UploadFilesWithoutCOM](./ASP/UploadFileWithoutCOM)
- [UploadFilesWithoutCOMv2](./ASP/UploadFileWithoutCOMv2)
- [UploadFilesWithoutCOMv3](./ASP/UploadFileWithoutCOMv3)

Scripts are listed by the date they were published on Planet Source Code between July 2000 to August 2004. Some scripts were written before I had an account there. In all, there are 220 scripts that I had uploaded to PSC. A limited number are simply documents.

PSC treated ASP, vbScript, and VBA as one "world", so server & client scripts are mixed between the two.
