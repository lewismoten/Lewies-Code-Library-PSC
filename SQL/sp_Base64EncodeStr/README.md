### sp_Base64EncodeStr

*12/2/2000 6:32:41 PM*

This procedure demonstrates how to instantiate an OLE object. I have used an ActiveX dll called AspConv™ (provided in AspLib™) to encode text with Base64 encoding in this example. The object must be registered on THE DATABASE SERVER (not to be confused with the web server/client/ or application server)
