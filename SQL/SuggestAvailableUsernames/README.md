### Suggest Available Usernames

*7/7/2001 12:14:46 PM*

Procedure created in order to determine if a duplicate user name exists during a sign up process. If a user name does not exist, an empty recordset is returned. Otherwise, any digits found at the end of the username are trimmed, and new usernames that do not yet exist are suggested with a suffix of numbers appended to the end.
