# [Lewie's Code Library PSC](../../README.md)

Open source projects that I had published to Planet Source Code.

## [SQL](../README.md)

### GrantUserExecuteAll

*11/8/2002 1:10:38 *

Allows you to specify a username and grant access to execute all SQL stored procedures within the current database. Very useful for developers that create databases with one account, but have programs accessing them through a seperate user account. This is an update to an old piece of code I had on PSC that limited to the public account.
