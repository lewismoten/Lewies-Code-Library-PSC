### Lewies Ansi/Ascii Painter

*8/3/2004 12:58:28 AM*

Read and Edit *.ANS files.  Old BBS systems used to have Ansi files to display text as graphics before the days of the internet were popular.  This program can read just about any ansi file in ascii format and display it accurately.  It does not support Music or Animations.
