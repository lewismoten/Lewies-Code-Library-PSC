### Hide Basic Authentication with HMTL Forms

*2/17/2001 12:09:30 AM*

I figured out how to let my users login with a form rather then using the built in dialog for basic authentication. Only problem is, if they get the username/password wrong, then they will still get that built in dialog. Code has been attatched for anyone who could use it. Very much a barebones demonstration. Works with any form of Basic Authentication (IIS / AuthentiX). Doesn't depend on any specific form of Scripting language on the server. works with cold fusion, perl, asp, etc. Tested with Netscape 3.04, 5, and Internet Explorer 5.5
