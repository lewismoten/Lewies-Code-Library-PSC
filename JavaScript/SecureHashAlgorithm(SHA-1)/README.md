### Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1)

*4/13/2001 8:32:40 PM*

The function generates a 160-bit (40-hex-digits representing 20 bytes) message digest for a given message (String) of any length. The digest is unique to the message. It is not possible to recover the message from the digest. The only way to find the source message for a digest is by the brute force hashing of all possible messages and comparison of their digests.
