### Mouse Looker

*6/5/2004 2:19:13 AM*

Take 9 pictures of yourself looking in 9 directions and assemble them to look at the users mouse depending on its location relative to your image. My wife thinks it's funny because she asks for money and drags the mouse above and below the image a few times so that I nod "yes".
