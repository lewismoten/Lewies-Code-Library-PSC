## JavaScript

Open source projects that I had published to Planet Source Code.

## [Hide Basic Authentication with HMTL Forms](./HideBasicAuthenticationWithHMTLForms)

*2/17/2001 12:09:30 AM*

I figured out how to let my users login with a form rather then using the built in dialog for basic authentication. Only problem is, if they get the username/password wrong, then they will still get that built in dialog. Code has been attatched for anyone who could use it. Very much a barebones demonstration. Works with any form of Basic Authentication (IIS / AuthentiX). Doesn't depend on any specific form of Scripting language on the server. works with cold fusion, perl, asp, etc. Tested with Netscape 3.04, 5, and Internet Explorer 5.5


## [Make Absolute URL](./MakeAbsoluteURL)

*2/17/2001 2:48:32 PM*

Converts a relevent url to an absolute URL. login.asp would become http://www.yourdomain.com/your/directory/structure/login.asp


## [Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1)](./SecureHashAlgorithm(SHA-1))

*4/13/2001 8:32:40 PM*

The function generates a 160-bit (40-hex-digits representing 20 bytes) message digest for a given message (String) of any length. The digest is unique to the message. It is not possible to recover the message from the digest. The only way to find the source message for a digest is by the brute force hashing of all possible messages and comparison of their digests.


## [Decimal to Hex](./DecimalToHex)

*4/29/2001 7:29:50 AM*

Converts a decimal number to a Hex String (i.e. 255 = 'FF')


## [Center Popup Windows](./CenterPopupWindows)

*2/6/2002 10:50:09 AM*

Center popup windows in the middle of your browser.


## [Request_QueryString](./Request_QueryString)

## [Random Pronouncable Password](./RandomPronouncablePassword)

*4/28/2002 5:50:02 PM*

## [RandomInt](./RandomInt)

*2/27/2004 8:12:43 PM*

## [Mouse Looker](./MouseLooker)

*6/5/2004 2:19:13 AM*

Take 9 pictures of yourself looking in 9 directions and assemble them to look at the users mouse depending on its location relative to your image. My wife thinks it's funny because she asks for money and drags the mouse above and below the image a few times so that I nod "yes".
