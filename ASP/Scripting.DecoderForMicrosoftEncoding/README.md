### Scripting.Decoder for Microsoft Encoding

*3/11/2001 5:15:43 PM*

This code lets you decode your scripts. It comes in handy if you deleted the original file or wrote over it with the encoded version. Microsoft included a program to encode, but choose not to let us decode with a scrdec program. More details can be found on my site about this script including a live demonstration. Please leave comments here if you wish to inquire about it.
