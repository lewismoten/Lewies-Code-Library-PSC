Convert HTML web pages into Word documents. This is great for creating word documents on the fly. Can be used to email documents after finnished converting. This code is in various places on the web. I'm supprised I didn't find it on PSC. This is my own version for you to modify as you wish. Larger files take longer to process. My waiting period is not good! System resources will be pegged. Seems to have problems with Website URLs, but files on the same server don't give me as many problems.
