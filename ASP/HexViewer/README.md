### Hex Viewer

*4/30/2001 10:07:08 PM*

Allows you to view the binary data of any file (GIF, JPG, ZIP, TXT, HTM, ASP) as if you were looking at a common hex viewer. Bytes are displayed as Hex characters and character data is displayed on the right. Starting positions of each row are displayed on the left.
