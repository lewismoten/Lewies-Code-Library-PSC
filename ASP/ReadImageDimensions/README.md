### Read Image Dimensions

*5/2/2001 2:16:32 PM*

Allows you to read the width and height for GIF, JPEG (JPG/JFIF), Bitmap(BMP), and PNG files. You can upload a file or load a binary file from the server in the demonstration. This is great when you allow users to Upload files and need to ensure that they fit within a specific set of boundries (ie - uploading banners). Update - Now supports AVI, MOV, MPG/MPEG, and SWF with support from my brother Lucas Moten. JPEG files have also been fixed to read correctly.
