<%=BreadCrumbs()%>
<P>
	Calling this routine from any folder with return navigation to
	each folder above it.  By todays standards, this type of navigation is called "Bread Crumbs".
	The term came from a Fairy Tale called
	<A href="http://www.mordent.com/folktales/grimms/hng/hng.html"><I>Hansel and Gretel</I></A>
	where a boy leaves bread crumbs in a forest to find his way back home.
