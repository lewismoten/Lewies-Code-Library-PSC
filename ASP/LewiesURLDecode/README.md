### Lewies URLDecode

*6/22/2001 5:33:47 PM*

Xao Xiong originally posted his version of DecodeURL and asked for a reply for a better way. I replied, but it didn't turn out too well, so i'm posting it here for him to see. The approach i took is that when you look at an encoded URL string, 2 hex characters follow a percent sign. XAO listed a few to translate into actual characters, but he didn't account for all 256 of them. Check it out!
