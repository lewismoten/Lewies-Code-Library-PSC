### Color Picker (Fallout)

*2/28/2002 10:35:56 PM*

Allow users to choose colors from familiar interfaces that are standard to the windows operating system. This one displays a wide range of hues in a color spectrum and fades the saturation. An additional scriptlet appears to change the luminance of each color chosen.
