### Forced Download 2

*9/4/2003 11:07:34 AM*

Allows you to force a file to be downloaded rather then displayed within the users browser. This can be used with Word documents, Excel Spreadsheets, Adobe PDF's, and other files. Script has been optimized to support large downloads and be dynamically called to download any file (except ASP, ASPX, ASA, ASAX, MDB files). Also clears up some problems with currupt files users had been having by clearing all previouse content and headers.
