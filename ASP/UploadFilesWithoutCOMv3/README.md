### Upload Files Without COM v3

*9/1/2003 11:19:59 PM*

Allows you to upload multiple files and fields without purchasing or registering COM objects. Great for shared hosts that frown upon 3rd Party com objects or charge an arm and a leg for them. This script provides an object oriented interface using classes for easier development. The power that this script has over others is that it does not use dictionary objects to store the uploaded files. It also harnesses the power of ADODB to prepare and save binary data to the file system with quick speeds. This is the script that you have been looking for. You can get a really good feel for how the script is used just by reading through the FAQ and examples provided. This script has been tailored to meet the requests of developers who have used previouse versions. The code is comented very well and comes along with examples of how to do common operations, as well as a FAQ. Bugs from version 2 have been fixed, or otherwise throw exceptions to the user giving them details of how to correct the problem (such as giving permission to the internet user account). Memory is managed more efficiently in version 3 that allows for more scaleablity and larger files. By the request of a few developers, progress bars are now supported to notify the user how much information has been received by the server. A website for support has also been created where you can get help from the author, other users of the script, and get any recent revisions or additional examples as they become available.
