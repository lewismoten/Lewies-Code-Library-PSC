### Parse Metadata from URLs

*5/4/2001 2:09:54 PM*

This class demonstrates how you can request the HTML of a URL from another website using the XMLHTTP object to spider the web page. (Simular to the methods of the ASPHttp object). The data is parsed and made available through a class object. This code is great if you are thinking about creating a Search Engine - or you just want to verify that URLs exist that users may place in there profiles. Also handy for finding broken links. If your server has IE5, or XML objects from Microsoft installed on it, then you should be able to use this demonstration without any problems.
