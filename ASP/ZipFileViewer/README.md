### Zip File Viewer

Display a list of files within a zip files archive along with the compressed/uncompressed size, ratio, path, etc. Always wanted to do this, but usually found code refering to winzip or some api calls. This is strait ASP. Performance is not at its best - this is a working concept. You can see the results in action on my website (www.lewismoten.com)
