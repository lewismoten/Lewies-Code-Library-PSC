### Add E-Mail Job to SQL Server

*6/4/2001 5:19:22 PM*

This script helps start you off to learning how to automate some of your processes with SQL . For this example, I have chosen to send Email through SQL Server using vbScript. Messages are pulled from a table and deleted once they are sent. You need to create a table in the master database called "Email" and assign the fields "To", "From", "Subject" and "Body". The script will do the rest. If you "SA" account has a password, you will need to modify the script to relflect those changes.
