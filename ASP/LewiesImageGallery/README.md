### Lewie's Image Gallery

Upload, Manage, and Display images within your own personal art gallery. This Image Bank was made for my girl friend so that she could easily add the images and change them on her own. It also offers categories. To administrate, goto admin.asp and type Administrator/Password to login. User accounts can be added and changed in the administration section. You can delete user accounts as long as 1 account will still remain. Images upload without COM.
