    This article is here to explain how you can simulate a service through javascript. It can allow you to view your latest news from each page on your website, or let other websites display your news links.

    Take a look at a news feed I created for <A href="http://www.theonlinegamer.com/News/Instructions.asp">The Online Gamer</A>. This is a completed service. It instructs the visitor as to the HTML they have to put into there web pages and a few options they have control over.
    </P>

    The files included within this article only start you off into the rite direction. The following files are present:
    </P>
    <UL>
    <LI><B>News.asp</B> - a page to display the articles contents. (expects querystring paramter "NewsID")
    <LI><B>FrontPage.asp</B> - page displaying news within your database. Also includes a news feed on the right hand side with the latest articles.
    <LI><B>News.js.asp</B> - this is the javascript that you will expose to your visitors.
    <LI><B>News.mdb</B> - this is an access database containing your news.
    </UL>
    <P>
    Accross your website, you can add the latest news to your pages by including a simple SCRIPT reference like so:
    </P>
    <PRE>&lt;SCRIPT src="/News.js.asp"&gt;&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</PRE>
    <P>
    Not only that, but you can instruct your visitors to adding news to there sites by doing the same, but pointing to your website.
    </P>
    <PRE>&lt;SCRIPT src="http://www.yourdomain.com/News.js.asp"&gt;&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</PRE>
    <P>
    The next part is within the asp page itself. Query your database and build an HTML string rather then writing it out to your web page.
    When the string is fully compiled, you can convert it to a javascript string and then write it out as javascript.
    </P>
    <PRE>document.write('&lt;%=ToJavascript(MyHTML)%&gt;');</PRE>
    <P>
    This is the basics of exposing your news as a service.
