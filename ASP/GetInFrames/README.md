### Get In Frames

*7/21/2000 1:59:41 PM*

Search engines point users to individual web pages. If the page is supposed to be displayed within a set of frames, this code will redirect the users to a specific page using javascript. From there, the new page parses which page it should display and loads up the frames accordingly.
