### RC4 Class

Applys Encryption/Decryption to strings. I think just about everyone who has seen my code knows how I love classes. This version is more "cleaned up" and thrown into a nice little class for an object oriented feeling. (If only ASP was object oriented, I would be a happy camper). It is also a little more optimized to run quicker if you change the Key/Password often.
