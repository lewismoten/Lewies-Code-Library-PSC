### vbScript ColorCoder v2.0

*5/8/2001 12:24:56 PM*

This script colorizes your vbScript for display on web pages. All colors can be managed through a style sheet. It seems that those who knew about the results of this version (from browsing my website) always kept asking me for the code and my old version that I refered them to was out-dated and didn't come close enough to there expectations. So peeps - I give to you my most proud and recent version of the color coder.
