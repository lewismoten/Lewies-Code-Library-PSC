### Color Picker 2

*4/29/2001 1:00:17 PM*

This version of the Color Picker supports just about any browser that uses javascript - Including Netscape 3. The downfall is that you "must" run it with a server that allows ASP. A script is included to create "dynamic" images of various colors. Thus - more bandwidth is used to allow visitors to choose colors. It is still a great asset to anyone who wishes to allow users to pick colors dynamically to affect the sites layout and design instantly.
