    The spinner control was something I found on one of the color pickers that Microsoft includes with Office 2000. My friends could tell you that I like to play with color interfaces ...

    The spinner control allows you to incriment, and deincriment a number by just clicking on a button. For the demonstration, I have also included a input field to demonstrate what the current value is.

    The placement of the buttons gave me a little bit of trouble due to the borders around them, until I came up with the idea of using clientHeight and clientWidth properties exposed by the document.body object "After" the window has loaded.

    <P>
    The one thing I wish I could get into the programming was the ability to hold the mouse down and incriment the value. I created an interval timer to incriment every 500 miliseconds. No events would seem to fire until I let up on the mouse. My hypotheses is that the scriptlet can not raise an event because the external window is frozen while the user directly interacts with the scriptlet.

    If someone knows of a way to get around this, comments would be greatly appreciated. You may find the original code to handle the timer within the source, but it is commented out.

    The following properties are exposed
    </P>
    <UL>
    <LI><B>Step</B> - number to add/subtract from the current value when a button is clicked.
    <LI><B>Value</B> - current value of the spinner
    <LI><B>Max</B> - maximum value that spinner can hold.
    <LI><B>Min</B> - minimum value that spinner can hold.
    </UL>
    <P>
    The following evetns are exposed
    </P>
    <UL>
    <LI><B>OnChange(), Value</B> - lets parent container know that the value of the spinner has changed. Event data passed is the new Value.
