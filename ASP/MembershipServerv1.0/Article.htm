This is the first version of my membership services (Proof of Concept). It allows you to create member accounts on a centralized web server. After this is done, a user can log into any website that offes this service so that they do not have to create new accounts each time that they want to join a site within your network. I like to refer to this as a very lite version of Microsoft Passport. There are plans in the future to impliment security, add validation (via email) and add profiles.
    <P>
    This service uses the XMLHTTP component that is available on most shared web servers (installed with IE 4.0 and up by default). If you do not have access to this component, or wish to use another one, then you will need to modify the code.
    <P>
    Ok, the code is here if you are interested and comments a greatly welcomed.
