### StrConv Unicode/Ascii

*9/4/2003 11:26:21 PM*

Converts between unicode and ANSI using ADODB Streams and recordsets. I was pressing myself to the limit to find a faster way to convert strings back and forth between unicode and ANSI during file uploads. This version goes the distance and has great speed.
