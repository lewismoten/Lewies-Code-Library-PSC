### RC4 Encryption/Decryption

*5/8/2001 2:01:12 AM*

Encrypts and Decrypts data using the RC4 algorithm and a Key/Password. Many thanks goes to many, many people on PSC and the internet for helping me through this. Sebastions code over at the Visual Basic section was a good start. This code runs quick in one function and is slightly commented. note - RSA patent expired in September 2000.
