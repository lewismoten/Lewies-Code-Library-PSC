### Small Pagination Navigation

*5/6/2001 4:02:44 PM*

I've coded many dynamic pages that needed the support of displaying data accross multiple pages. Whith this script, it will build a small navigation that you can display at the top and/or bottom of your results to navigate to the next page. It also supports the ability to only display pages within a specified range. (ie - if you have 1000 pages, it will only write links to 5 of the pages closest to the current page being viewed.)
