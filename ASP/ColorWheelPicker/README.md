### Color Wheel Picker

*2/27/2002 11:38:27 PM*

I was working on a scriptlet to allow users to choose a color. A color wheel is displayed with an assortment of colors - most of witch are web-safe. Clicking on a color causes it to be outlined and raise an event that a color was chosen. This object mimics one of the color-picker forms found in Microsoft Office 2000. This scriplet does not yet raise events or expose properties. The basics, however are available for you to be amazed.
