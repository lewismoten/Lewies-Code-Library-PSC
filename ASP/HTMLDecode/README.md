### HTMLDecode

*8/6/2001 11:31:07 AM*

This function decodes HTML Encoded strings. I found that when some browsers post data, it converts double-byte characters to html encoded characters. This script searches for all numerical entities as well as a few popular named entities. You will need to tell the server and the web browser that you are working with Unicode characters. The code has been included for working with the UTF-7 character set. Enjoy!
