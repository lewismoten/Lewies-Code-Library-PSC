### Sorted Record Listing with Search v2.0

*1/21/2001 1:44:57 PM*

After getting great reviews on the previous version, I finally got time to do the rewrite that I promised everyone. This code allows you to easily create lists of your data with pagination, sorting, and filtering. The end result is a very nice layout of your data. You choose which fields come back (an the captions for each one in the header). Choose which fields are searched. Setup the default field that is sorted when visitor first views page. Now supports databases with list ordering. This time I have included a database so it should work as soon as you add the files to your website.
