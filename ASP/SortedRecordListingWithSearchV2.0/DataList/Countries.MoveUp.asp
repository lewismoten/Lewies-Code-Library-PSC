<P>
	If the table supports ListOrdering, you would query the database to move
	the list order of the current record up one (ListOrder -1).  All records
	that have a list order matching or greater then the current records new
	list order would be moved down (ListOrder +1).  The page should then redirect
	the user back to the datalist.
