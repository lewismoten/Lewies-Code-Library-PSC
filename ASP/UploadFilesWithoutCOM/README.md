### Upload Files Without COM

*1/13/2001 4:56:05 PM*

Allows you to upload multiple files and fields without purchasing or registering COM objects. Great for shared hosts that frown upon 3rd Party com objects or charge an arm and a leg for them. This version uses Classes rather then the dictionary object that I have seem most other people use. Dictionary Objects seem to be flakey with more problems. I have added examples of how to upload a file to a database and the file system. A file is also included that retreives the file from the database.
