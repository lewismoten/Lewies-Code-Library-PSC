### Dynamic DNS Update IP Parser

*9/4/2003 1:52:03 PM*

Has ability to go out on the internet and determine what your current IP address is. Also allows you ability to update namecheap.com with your current IP address. Can be modified to use with other dynamic dns services. Thanks goes to Kenny for letting me know about this cheap DNS host!
