### Helpful Checkbox Functions

*5/5/2001 2:27:46 PM*

Ok, I'm uploading something that is very simple this time - but this is one of the most used things that I have. These little functions help me make code smaller and change the wording to users viewing the text next to a check box. I find that if you change the words based on what the user has chosen, it feels a little more comfortable to them.
