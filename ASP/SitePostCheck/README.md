### Site Post Check

*2/14/2002 10:58:19 PM*

Checks the HTTP Referer header to ensure people are not posting from other websites. You can include this file if you use templates on your website, or just include it on the pages that receive form data posts. Warning - someone who knows there stuff can get around this by modifying there HOST file. this isn't 100% fool proof, but it may deter most from posting data from other websites.
