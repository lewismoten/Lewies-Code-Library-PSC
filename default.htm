		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
			Over the many years, I had posted small pieces of code onto the internet.
			This was primarily done so that I would have a centralized location to
			access my files from anywhere.  The best explination I can think of is that
			this was more like a personal hard drive where the public had read-only access.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, I got a little famouse along the way.  Not majorly, but I would
			receive a ton of e-mail with questions.  I even got a new job during the .com
			craze where they came to me.  Well, the fame has dies down and I have survived
			the dot com crash.
		</p>
		<p>  
			I have formed a noble value along the way ... the ability to teach.  To make 
			little scripts public for others to learn from - as long as it is not proprietary
			information that is sensitive to my employer or my clients.  So you will not
			find any robust applications here that you can sell off or compete with.
